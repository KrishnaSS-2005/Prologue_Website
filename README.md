# 📚 PROLOGUE — The Reading Club of LBSITW

A responsive, single-page website for **PROLOGUE**, the official reading club of LBSITW, built for the Tech Team selection task.

## 🔗 Live Site
Live Website (GitHub Pages): `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/`

## 🖥️ Overview

The site is a single `index.html` page with anchored sections, built using **only HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks, no build step) so it can be opened directly or hosted with GitHub Pages as-is.

| Section | What it covers |
|---|---|
| 🏠 Home | Hero intro, tagline, CTA buttons, and a rotating "up next" activity ticker |
| 📖 About | Club story, vision & mission, plus animated stat counters (members, books, events, years) |
| ✨ Why Join | Six benefit cards covering what members gain |
| 🎭 Activities | Card grid of recurring club activities |
| 📅 Events | Tabbed Upcoming / Past events list |
| 📝 Membership Registration | Full sign-up form with live validation |
| 🖼️ Gallery | Photo grid with a click-to-open lightbox (prev/next + keyboard + Esc) |
| 📱 Contact & Socials | Contact details, quick links, and social icons in the footer |

## ⚙️ Interactive JavaScript Features

- **Sticky/blurred navbar** that reacts to scroll position
- **Mobile hamburger menu** with slide-in panel
- **Rotating hero ticker** cycling through upcoming activities
- **Scroll-triggered animated counters** using `IntersectionObserver`
- **Tabbed Events section** (Upcoming / Past) with no page reload
- **Gallery lightbox** — click any photo to open a full-screen viewer with previous/next navigation, keyboard arrow support, and Escape-to-close
- **Membership form validation** — real-time (on blur) and on-submit checks for name, register number, department, year, email format, 10-digit phone number, a minimum-length motivation message, and the code-of-conduct checkbox, with inline error messages and a success confirmation (no backend required)

## 🎨 Design

- Warm cream / ink / brown palette matching the PROLOGUE brand mark
- `Playfair Display` for headings, `Inter` for body text (Google Fonts)
- Fully responsive: fluid grid layouts collapse from 3/4 columns on desktop down to a single column on mobile, with a dedicated mobile navigation drawer
